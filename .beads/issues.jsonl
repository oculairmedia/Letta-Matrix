{"id":"bd-9cq","title":"Implement extract_agent_mentions() function for parsing @mentions","description":"## Summary\nCreate a function to extract agent @mentions from Matrix message bodies, supporting both MXID format and friendly agent names.\n\n## Location\n`src/matrix/client.py` (or new module `src/matrix/mention_parser.py`)\n\n## Function Signature\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\ndef extract_agent_mentions(body: str) -\u003e List[Tuple[str, str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract @agent mentions from message body.\n    \n    Args:\n        body: The message body text\n        \n    Returns:\n        List of (matched_text, agent_id, agent_name) tuples\n        - matched_text: The original mention string found\n        - agent_id: Resolved Letta agent ID\n        - agent_name: Agent display name\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n## Patterns to Match\n\n### 1. Full MXID Pattern\n`@agent_[uuid_with_underscores]:matrix.domain`\n- Example: `@agent_597b5756_2915_4560_ba6b_91005f085166:matrix.oculair.ca`\n- Regex: `@agent_[a-f0-9_]+:[a-z0-9._-]+`\n\n### 2. Friendly Name Pattern  \n`@AgentName` (word boundary, case-insensitive)\n- Example: `@Meridian`, `@BMO`, `@GraphitiExplorer`\n- Must resolve via `get_mapping_by_agent_name()`\n- Handle multi-word names: `@Matrix Synapse Deployment` (tricky - may need quotes or camelCase)\n\n## Important: Strip Reply Fallback\nMatrix replies include quoted content. Must extract mentions only from NEW message, not quoted text.\n\n```python\n# Strip Matrix reply fallback format:\n# \u003e \u003c@user:domain\u003e original message\n# \u003e continued quote\n#\n# Actual new message here\n\ndef strip_reply_fallback(body: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Remove Matrix reply quoted content, keep only new message\"\"\"\n    lines = body.split('\\n')\n    if not lines[0].startswith('\u003e '):\n        return body\n    # Find first non-quote line after blank line\n    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n        if i \u003e 0 and line == '' and lines[i-1].startswith('\u003e'):\n            return '\\n'.join(lines[i+1:])\n    return body\n```\n\n## Resolution Flow\n1. Strip reply fallback\n2. Find all @mentions via regex\n3. For each mention:\n   - If MXID format → `get_mapping_by_matrix_user()`\n   - If name format → `get_mapping_by_agent_name()`\n4. Return list of resolved agents (skip unresolved)\n\n## Edge Cases\n- [ ] Self-mention (agent mentions itself) - include but flag\n- [ ] Unknown agent name - log warning, skip\n- [ ] Multiple mentions of same agent - deduplicate\n- [ ] Mention in code block - should we skip? (probably not for MVP)\n- [ ] Partial name match ambiguity - log, pick first/best\n\n## Tests\n- [ ] Single MXID mention\n- [ ] Single name mention  \n- [ ] Multiple mentions (mixed types)\n- [ ] Reply with mentions in quote AND new text - only extract from new\n- [ ] No mentions returns empty list\n- [ ] Invalid/unknown mention logs warning\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on: bd-7jk (agent name resolution)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T18:39:00.16962608-05:00","updated_at":"2026-02-08T07:54:24.710031714Z","closed_at":"2026-01-17T22:28:54.002658542-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["feature","huly:MXSYN-323","mention-routing","vibe:1342da3f-9ffc-4850-862c-0b285df4bf83"]}

Detect the audio event in the message callback\n2. Download the audio file from the Matrix media server\n3. Transcribe it using OpenAI Whisper or Mistral Voxtral (matching LettaBot's provider config)\n4. Send the transcribed text as `[Voice message]: {text}` through the normal WS gateway message pipeline\n\n### Outbound (Agent → TTS → Voice Message)\nWhen the agent responds with a `\u003cvoice\u003e` directive, the bridge should:\n1. Parse the `\u003cactions\u003e\u003cvoice\u003etext\u003c/voice\u003e\u003c/actions\u003e` block from the assistant response\n2. Call TTS service (ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS)\n3.

The native Letta bridge (lettabot's own channels like Telegram/Slack) has a more natural feel — typing pulses with token cadence. Since the WS gateway now streams token-level chunks before we accumulate them, we can use those chunks to drive a more natural typing animation: re-trigger the typing indicator on each token arrival, creating a pulse that matches the agent's actual output rhythm. May also consider showing partial content via live-edit as tokens arrive (like ChatGPT) instead of waiting for the full accumulated response.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"noreply@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-02-08T23:51:56.611007835-05:00","created_by":"Claude Code","updated_at":"2026-02-08T23:52:08.944981655-05:00","labels":["huly:MXSYN-372","vibe:bdbcdfde-45cb-49e9-b35d-674251e56ab5"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-d7f9.9","depends_on_id":"bd-d7f9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-08T23:51:56.61335446-05:00","created_by":"Claude Code"}]}

When an agent mentions another agent (e.g., `@Meridian`), the message should automatically be forwarded to the mentioned agent's room.\n\n## Problem Statement\nCurrently, when Agent A wants to communicate with Agent B:\n1. Agent A must use `talk_to_agent` operation (verbose) OR\n2. Agent A must know Agent B's exact room_id (error-prone)\n\nA recent bug occurred where an agent used `send` with its OWN room_id instead of the target agent's room, causing the message to go to the wrong place.\n\n## Solution\nParse messages for @mentions and automatically forward to mentioned agents' rooms. Messages appear in BOTH rooms for complete audit trail.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an agent, I can mention @Meridian in my message and it will be delivered to Meridian\n- As Emmanuel (admin), I can see the full conversation flow in both agents' rooms\n- As a developer, I can debug inter-agent communication via logs\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- [ ] **bd-7jk** - Add agent name resolution by display name\n- [ ] **bd-9cq** - Implement extract_agent_mentions() parser\n\n### Phase 2: Core Feature  \n- [ ] **bd-r79** - Implement forward_to_agent_room()\n- [ ] **bd-rsp** - Integrate routing into message_callback (P1)\n\n### Phase 3: Polish\n- [ ] **bd-d38** - Update agent system prompts\n- [ ] **bd-cnx** - Add comprehensive tests\n- [ ] **bd-0nx** - Add logging and observability\n\n### Phase 4: Cleanup (Optional)\n- [ ] **bd-x4v** - Rename container to letta-matrix-bridge\n\n## Supported Mention Formats\n1. `@AgentName` - Friendly name (case-insensitive)\n2. `@agent_uuid:matrix.domain` - Full MXID\n\n## Key Behaviors\n- **Dual posting**: Message appears in source room AND target room(s)\n- **Loop prevention**: Forwarded messages marked with `m.forwarded` flag\n- **Self-mention skip**: Agent mentioning itself doesn't trigger forward\n- **Multiple mentions**: One message can forward to multiple agents\n- **Reply handling**: Only parse mentions in new content, not quoted replies\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Agent can send `@Meridian hello` and Meridian receives it\n- [ ] Message visible in both rooms for audit\n- [ ] No infinite loops from forwarded messages\n- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging\n- [ ] Tests pass in CI\n\n## Related Issues\n- bd-7jk\n- bd-9cq  \n- bd-r79\n- bd-rsp\n- bd-d38\n- bd-cnx\n- bd-0nx\n- bd-x4v","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T18:42:16.202760667-05:00","updated_at":"2026-02-08T07:54:24.586175199Z","closed_at":"2026-01-17T22:28:53.986609614-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["epic","feature","huly:MXSYN-319","inter-agent","mention-routing"]}
