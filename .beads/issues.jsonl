Instead of full responses, only fragments like `\":\"`, `\"'s happening:\"` appeared.\n\n**Root Cause:** The `extractAssistantContent()` function in `letta-webhook-handler.ts` only handled string content. Letta v1 agents send content in array format:\n```json\n{\"content\": [{\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"actual message\"}]}\n```\n\nThe old code fell back to `JSON.stringify()` which produced truncated output.\n\n### Fix Applied\n1. **`letta-webhook-handler.ts`** - Added `extractContentText()` method that properly handles:\n   - String content (direct return)\n   - Array of content parts (extracts `{type: \"text\", text: \"...\"}` entries)\n   - Object with `text` field\n   - Fallback with warning for unknown formats\n\n2. **`webhook-server.ts`** - Improved debug logging to show content type and preview\n\n3. **`tests/webhook-content-extraction.test.ts`** - 25 unit tests covering all content formats and regression tests\n\n### Verification\n- Before: `content length: 1, preview: \":\"`\n- After: `content length: 108, preview: \"Hello! 👋 I received your webhook test message...\"`\n\nAll 25 tests pass. Fix deployed and verified with live webhook.","created_at":"2026-01-02T18:51:33Z"}]}
