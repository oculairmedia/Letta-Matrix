{"id":"matrix-synapse-deployment-e2c","title":"Add agent health check to detect stuck approval states","description":"The Houdini MCP agent became unresponsive because it had pending tool approvals that were never processed. The periodic agent sync doesn't detect this state.\n\nProblem:\n- Agent has pending approval_request_message blocking all new messages\n- Matrix bridge keeps forwarding messages but gets CONFLICT errors\n- No automatic recovery - requires manual API call to approve/deny\n\nSolution options:\n1. Add health check in periodic sync to detect agents with pending approvals\n2. Auto-approve or auto-deny stale approval requests (configurable timeout)\n3. Send notification to Matrix when agent is blocked by pending approval\n4. Add /approve and /deny commands to Matrix for manual resolution\n\nRelated: The streaming module now parses approval_request_message but doesn't send approval responses back to Letta yet.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T12:58:08.00041429-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T12:58:08.00041429-05:00"}
